WayBackPack RSS Feed Collector

    Usage:   ${PROGNAME}

    This command updates a mysql database named "plato" based on the OPTIONS
    provided in the run command.  If no OPTIONS are specified, then it will
    update every RSS Feed from its internal list based on the internal DTSTART
    value (currently set to ${DTSTART}).

CMD:

    -u, -update, u, update
        Bring the database up-to-date by filling in all the data starting from
        the latest date found in the Items table and ending on today's date.

EXAMPLES:
    Command to update plato database with all articles since ${DTSTART}:

        bash$  ./${PROGNAME}

    Command to start ${PROGNAME} and update all RSS feeds with articles that
    have been released since the last time this script was run:

    	bash$  ./${PROGNAME} update

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  GetUpdateDates  -  query the database for the latest date in the Exch table
#                     then set the range to cover from that date to the current
#                     date
